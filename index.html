	    <p>Two brothers inherit a large field. They decide to split the field 
	       perfectly in half. However, later that night the younger brother feels that 
	       his older brother deserves more, and so without telling him, he gives his 
	       older brother one third of his portion. The older brother, has the same thought, 
	       and decides to give his brother one third of his land (not realizing that 
	       his current land was more than half of the field because of the gift from his brother).</p>
		</div>

			<p>What percent of the entire field does the younger and older brother now own?</p>
		
			<p>What if the brothers continued giving one third of their field to the other each night, 
			   what percent would each own after ten nights? </p>
