                <p>Two brothers inherit a large wheat field. They decide to split the field 
                   perfectly in half. However, later that night the younger brother feels that 
                   his older brother deserves more, and so without telling him, he gives his 
                   older brother one third of his portion. The older brother, has the same thought, 
                   and decides to give his brother one third of his land (not realizing that 
                   his current land was more than half of the field because of the gift from his brother). Answer the following:</p>
